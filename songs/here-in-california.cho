{sov: Verse 1}
When I was [G]young my [D]ma-ma [G]told me
She said [D]child take your [Em]time
Don't [C/G]fall in love too [G]quickly
Be[Am]fore you know your [C/G]mind
She [G]held me [D]round the [G]shoulders
In a [D]voice so soft and [Em]kind
She said [C/G]love can make you [G]happy
And [Am]love can rob you [G]blind
{eov}

{soc: Chorus}
[C/G]Here in[D] Califor[G]nia
[Am]The fruit hangs [D]heavy on the [Em]vines
There's no [C/G]gold, thought I'd [G]warn you
And the [Am]hills turn [D]brown in the summer[G]time
{eoc}

{sov: Verse 2}
Now [G]I will [D]learn to love [G]you
Oh but [D]I can't say [Em]when
This mor[C/G]ning we were stra[G]ngers
And to[Am]night we're only [C/G]friends
But I'll [G]take my time[D] to know [G]you
I'll [D]take my time to [Em]see
There's [C/G]nothing I won't show [G]you
If you [Am]take your time with [G]me

{sov: Verse 3}
Itâ€™s an [G]old [D]familiar [G]story
An [D]old familiar [Em]rhyme
To every[C/G]thing there is a [G]season
To eve[Am]ry purpose there is a [C/G]time
A time to [G]love and [D]come to[G]gether
A time when [D]love longs for a [Em]name
A time for [C/G]questions we can't [G]answer
But we [Am]ask them just the [G]same
